This is one of my first React projects.
The main learning objective of this project was to get more familiar with passing props & building a comment form in React.
I took inspiration from blogs about Japananese gardens & styled the app in line with Zen Garden aesthetic.

## What I've learned
- Difference between functional & class components in React
- Got more comfirtable using React onChange event handlers. 
- Ways of updating data in React forms
- Use of useState hook
- Grouping components by file type

## Challenges
- Rendering the comments on click. Solved by doing more research on event handlers.
- Choosing the most elegant solution for displaying user initials. Solved by using array methods.
- Differentiation between global css & component-scoped css. Solved by planning out the scope of classes needed for certain components.


## Take Aways

I've learned a lot through this project & built a base for a blog that I can always improve on & iterate. 
My undertsnading of how I can manage React state with hooks has improved.
